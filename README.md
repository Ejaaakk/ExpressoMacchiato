api.route('/api/v1/example', 'GET', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, ExpressoMacchiato!');
});

api.start(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### Dynamic Routing

ExpressoMacchiato allows you to create dynamic routes easily. You can define routes based on parameters or patterns, making your API flexible and powerful.

Here’s an example of dynamic routing:

```javascript
api.route('/api/v1/users/:id', 'GET', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    // Fetch user data based on userId
    res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

### API Documentation

ExpressoMacchiato integrates with Swagger to provide clear API documentation. Once you set up your routes, you can generate the documentation automatically.

To access the Swagger UI, navigate to `/api-docs` after starting your server. You will see an interactive interface where you can test your API endpoints.
